          <h2>A proven track record to drive meaningful ROI through emails</h2>
          <p>
            Delighting your customers is good business. But as an entrepreneur,
            you care about the hard, cold numbers. The kind of numbers you can
            take to the bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here’s a typical example of what you can expect: one of my
            clients in the men’s lifestyle industry generates almost 20% of his
            monthly revenue from the automated email campaigns we’ve created:
          </p>
          <img src={dashboard} alt="dashboard" />
          <p>
            By first auditing the current email strategy and learning more about
            shoppers using visitors polls, we were able to build an automated
            personalized customer experience for all stages of the funnel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Combined with segmented newsletters, his email channel now accounts
            for more than 30% of his monthly sales, while creating lasting
            relationships with customers, respecting their inboxes and making
            sure they’re a valued part of the community.
